## Reporting Bugs and Creating Issues

You can submit an issue or a bug to our GitHub repository. You must provide:

- The link to the reproduction scenario you created using one of the Clarity StackBlitz Templates
- If possible, please provide a minimal demo illustrating the issue by forking one of the Clarity StackBlitz Templates
- The version number of Angular, Clarity and Clarity Addons
- The browser name and version number
- Screenshot is also a good way to show us what is the issue
- When providing the NPM package version, make sure to check them from the package-lock.json file. This is extremely important in the cases that NPM versioning tags are applied.

## Contribution Process for Developers

Start by [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository. Make your changes locally and be sure to run all tests, check the format and run the build with:

    npm run test:ci

Before submitting the pull request please rebase to the current master (or release branch) and check/test your code again.

Also provide some demo/documentation code in the website folder for the deployed documentation.

Next, create the pull request and provide a description of the changes. Reference any issue numbers when the code change fixes a bug or implements an enhancement.

### Testing the library locally

To test the clarity-addons library locally you can start a dev environment via "npm run start", which starts the application located in /src/dev. Feel free to add demo pages to test your component. This will be seen by developers only so it's for functional testing and doesn't have to meet any styling standards.

### Testing the documentation locally

To test the documentation which will be visible on the documentation page, execute the command "npm run start" inside the /website folder. Make sure to always add documentation when developing components.

## Versioning schema

A new version will be created whenever an important breaking change happens (e.g. massive refactoring), a new component is ready or a bugfix needs to be published

- MAJOR: following the respective Angular version
- MINOR: on every new component/feature
- PATCH: for bugfix only releases
