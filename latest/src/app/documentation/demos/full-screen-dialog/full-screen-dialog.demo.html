        <p>The Full Screen Dialog looks and feels like any other
            page though it is conceptually a modal dialog. This means that a full screen dialog can have any page layout. From a
            technical point of view, full screen dialogs are shown in a router outlet above the current page. This
            eliminates the loading time which usually occurs while navigating from page to page.</p>

        <div id="design-guidelines">
            <h3>Design Guidelines</h3>

            <p>A Full Screen Dialog usually contains mutliple input elements and <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Cancel</strong> options. Place these call to action buttons on the left side of the bottom of the page. Just like you would in a regular form. Optionally the dialog can also have a Back-button. Provide a confirmation promt if the user has already entered data and Back was selected. Note that this prompt is not required for the Cancel-button, since the user deliberately choose Cancel to discard the input.</p>

            <h3>Use when</h3>
            <p>Use the Full Screen Dialog if:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>You want to display a complex input form that requires <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Cancel</strong> options</li>
                <li>You need to show additional modal dialogs. In general you should not show another modal over a modal, but you can open a modal over a Full Screen Dialog.</li>
                <li>The dialog's content would require too much scrolling in a modal dialog. Try to avoid scrolling in modal dialogs.</li>
            </ul>
